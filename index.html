      <h3>Important Notice</h3>
      <p>
        The following story is intended to educate children and inspire adults struggling with addiction and mental
        health disorders. I myself is clinically insane with bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, and schizophrenia.
      </p>

      <p>
        On 26 May 1995, as soon as I turned one my parent got divorced in Taunggyi which is
the mountain area. (I remember the whole mountain turns pink in winter from cherry trees)
when I was exactly 3-year-old I saw a Superman movie and jumped down the stairs I thought
I was going to fly but instead, I was hospitalized with a broken elbow and been exposed to
sedatives at an early age. My brain chemicals had been changed, and it made me disability
with weak short-term memory. My real birthday was 26 September 1995. My family legally
changed it to 26 May 1995 so that I could get to kinder garden despite my undeveloped
brain being pushed by their greets of wanting not to care for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was 4, I was sent to the BEHS4 in Taunggyi and got sent to the kinder garden
for special kids or disabled kids with ADHD and we didnâ€™t know we had ADHD. Along with
that, I was sexually abused by the housemate every night as she would call me to play 
to have sex with me. My male part is barely able to stiff, and I was sexually abused and
assaulted and exposed the toxic femineity at an early age. Not only that my uncle would
squeeze my nipples often just to abuse me sexually altogether with my bipolar grandpa
and my middle aunt. My middle aunt would molest me touch my ass and have male body parts.
Not only that, but I also had a habit of vomiting when I started crying. Just to
discipline me my bipolar middle aunt would force me to eat what I vomited, and it worked
nicely.
