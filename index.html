    <section>
      <h3>Important Notice</h3>
      <p>
       The following story is intended to educate children and inspire adults struggling with addiction and mental
        health disorders. I am clinically insane with bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, and schizophrenia.
      </p>
<h4>Who is light?</h4>
      <p>
   On 26 May 1995, as soon as I turned one my parent got divorced in Taunggyi which is the mountain area. (I remember the whole mountain turns pink in winter from cherry trees) 
        when I was precisely 3-year-old I saw a Superman movie and jumped down the stairs I thought I was going to fly but instead, I was hospitalized with a broken elbow and  
        exposed to sedatives at an early age. My brain chemicals had been changed, and it made me disability with weak short-term memory. My actual birthday was 26 September 1995. 
        My family legally changed it to 26 May 1995 so that I could get to kinder garden despite my undeveloped brain being pushed by their greets of wanting not to care for me.
      </p>
      
      <p>
   When I was 4, I was sent to the BEHS4 in Taunggyi and got sent to the kinder garden
for special kids or disabled kids with ADHD and we didn’t know we had ADHD. Along with that, I was sexually abused by the housemate every night as she would call me to play 
to have sex with me. My male part is barely able to stiff, and I was sexually abused and
assaulted and exposed to toxic femineity at an early age. Not only that my uncle would
squeeze my nipples often just to abuse me sexually altogether with my bipolar grandpa
and my middle aunt. My middle aunt would molest me touch my ass and have male body parts. Not only that, but I also had a habit of vomiting when I started crying. Just to
discipline me my bipolar middle aunt would force me to eat what I vomited, and it worked
nicely.

      </p>
      
      <p>
  All my life I don’t have play time for socializing time as my childhood is filled
with tuition such as Grammar classes, math classes, Chinese language, and preschool training
classes and I don’t have any holidays as all my free time is filled with various classes.
On top of that, my aunt would ask me to study religion from Muslim priests. Most of the
priests 80% of them like to spread hatred through tales and lies. Some actively recruit
to be volunteer terrorists. They usually operate in the Rohingya area, and the truth is the
Rohingya are not as clear as real terrorists are hiding among them in the Yakine area
and Mother Su was not wrong to bring them down.

      </p>

       <p>
           Along with that work hard culture is deeply rooted in my family as I was forced to work at an early age. As a daredevil and trouble 
kid, playing with friends created minor problems and to avoid those, I was forced to play alone at home with various toys. I would
tear down toys to appreciate the circuit architecture and use Motors form toys just to
make a boat with junk I found in my house. Not only that I was a kid who occasionally drifted with bicycles by slamming rear brakes.
I used to have lots of pets including dogs and cats, but I could not care for them much as I was constantly occupied with my studies, 
and they ended up dying in accidents. After those accidents, I plan not to have any pets again and learn to love from a distance.

      </p>

       <p>
                 I would build a well from stones and leftover concrete. I would play with light
bulbs and AC sockets one time I remember I got an electric shock from doing such. I
remember my grandpa would buy me fish from the market and teach me how to breed them
and sell them. Also, I would play around with iron power powder and magnets. Also, I
remember playing with magnets attach the rope in the middle just to use it as a compass as the magnet usually sticks to the north and south sides. I would wrap the wire as coils push
the magnet in and out and see the light bulb blink. Sometimes I would play checker by myself.

      </p>

       <p>
          I develop reading Sherlock Homes, 5 Habits of Highly Effective People, body languages, and other books at an early age.
         When I turned 9, I started chewing tobacco and Bettles along with my classmates just for an escape. 
         I was involved in smoking (especially in the school bathroom) it is not permitted. At the same time, 
         I was a bully, and I would bully all my classmates, especially those who are perverted (deep down I hate the idea of toxic 
         masculinity from my grandpa and a sense to protect femineity and gay friends). I send love letters and Valentine's gifts to girls 
         which end up in trash cans all the time. At the same time, I started visiting my mom's restart in the market frequently without all
         my family members from my father's side aware of it.
      </p>

       <p>
           At the early 12, I started smoking my grandpa's leftover cigarettes and after that, I
started sealing my grandpa's 555 cigarettes and it was the best cigarette of my life. My
grandpa is harsh, and he hates the idea of wasting food I was forced to eat the food
that I dropped on the ground just to teach me a lesson. I would buy a pack of ciggie after high school
and hide and smoke it as my caretaker or aunt was too busy taking care of the family business and other disabled in my family. 
Along with that nightly drinking after tuition became habitual as the personal driver would buy a beer for me after every night 
along with occasional alcohol at a local bar.

      </p>

       <p>
         In late 13 I was sent to a special school, and it was the most productive year of my life as the hypnotherapist Dr A was the one in charge.
  Rumours were spared about him as Dr A is not his real name and his family got divorced at the same age as me. At the same
time, my obsession with Death Note started and I would watch Death Note repeatedly. At
the same time, I started reading mathematics-related books. Spookley would call my
other friends or roommates just to sleep with him and it was terrible. On top of that
occasion fights with bullies happen frequently among peers.

      </p>

       <p>
                  Who knows he would use spooky hypnosis on me and my friends. As I reported to my family, they moved me to another institute. At the same time, I have a frequent dream
about my aunt especially the big aunt and the middle aunt having sex with me in my dreams it happens daily. Also, the hypnotherapist would frequently assign tasks that are relatively
difficult to solve I believe I am the one who can answer the question most of the time.
There is a spoon on the water question he asks why the water did not drop if u keep
dripping on the spoon I try to give him an answer, but he rejects it every time he comes up
with a better solution to beat me down. I believe I said it was gravity, and he denied it as the truthful answer but managed to prove me wrong in his way. 

      </p>

       <p>
   At the same time, I would constantly watch Death Note repeatedly and I see myself as L as well as Killer in that Death Note character,
         I hate Killer who causes nothing but chaos and is egoistic and thinks himself delusional with his ego not a real intelligent. 
         I feel like my brain is being experimented and studied by him taking advantage of my disability despite the full money or fees he requested. 
         After that, I end up moving to another institute. When the A’s student got an A form following the teacher’s techniques, I was punished for using 
         other methods as I always found two to three methods just to solve a single mathematics problem but got
        rejected. 

      </p>

       <p>
             When they asked me to write English essays, I would write them in my understanding with my sentences and got punished for just not memorizing and 
         writing what the teacher as me to memorize essays. At the same time, my friend would tease me for having man boobs and squeeze my nipples for his 
         sexual pleasure needs. At 14 when I was in high school, I started using opioids with my friend James as he would scrap his brother left over raw opioids 
         and bring them to high schools that was the best high, I got as my would body weakened, and I remember I saw leaves dropping slowly form trees.
      </p>

       <p>
               After high school at 15, I was sent to an engineering school in Yangon as the school itself was relatively new and unprofessional, 
         I ended up moving and studying both foundations in Electrical and electronic engineering for six months followed by a six-month
         Business management foundation degree in Chindwin College Mandalay. In my college days, I would drink all the time, and I became 
         an alcoholic and got addicted to it. Also, I remember days I would wake up shaking hands and rush to a nearby bar to take a shot 
         just to stabilize as the social drinking culture in college is everywhere. At the same time, I started a distance relationship 
         with my first ex she ended up leaving me for another man and told me I was not enough.
      </p>

       <p>
         Along with that, I was involved with the car gang called GFD-ground force drifters and I drive a Nissan fair lady FZ33 along with Honda CBR 250 and CB 650R bicycles. 
         I would do dangerous stunts, drift cars burnout doughnuts, traffic races, drag races, involved in group fights, and smoke a mixture of weed and opioids. Along with that 
         jumping rope and boxing have become my daily activities. 
      </p>

       <p>
         On top of that, I learn how to drive Cranes and heavy-duty Trucks. I was enjoying
my life until when I was 19, my grandma passed away. Three months after that, for
mysterious reason, my father got hit in his head as his main business was doing
construction business with the authorities in building a new city called Nay Pyi Taw,
Chinese gas pipeline construction for natural gas supply and copper mining in red copper
Mountain area. I suspect he is unlawfully punished by authorities for knowing too much
about shady Chinese business and at that time the Burmese government own unpaid
depts from him.

      </p>

       <p>
         As a consequence, he suffers brain damage from blood clots. I was devastated
and as my dad was an addict who took Yaba for work and slept with raw opioids as
most government authorities and associate fellow businessmen would do, his
addiction problem got along with brain damage got worse I remember the time I had to
Search the supply in Nay Pyi Taw and personally arrange the transport of Yaba (the green one is special)
as well as asking for opioids from friends in GFD from him. I remember the days he would drive to the police authority house 
and buy opioids and Yaba from the Police.

      </p>

       <p>
Along with that, the Rohingya and Muslim massacres happen I remember the 969
Buddhist extremists (brainwashed and spoiled with Yaba and other drugs) would come to
near my home, as I live near a mosque I am a Chinese Muslim and I was shaking
and holding a kitchen knife just for protection I tried to ask help from the police and they
pretend like nothing happened although the extremists come to destroy the mosque and nearby buildings. 
At the same time, we send my father to a private rehab center. He is clean and we are planning to treat 
his blood clot problem in the brain he started using Yaba and
opioids again. Due to excessive use, wrong dosage adjustment, and his lung problems from
using Yaba, he got overdosed and had to be hospitalized and he passed away when I was
19. My family cannot file any lawsuit or case as my father's death is tied to Burmese
government authorization.

         
      </p>

       <p>
         Due to safety, my family plans to send me to study business management in
Singapore. Before that, I was left with my uncle in Nay Pyi Taw just to turn my father's 
leftover assets, but he took advantage of that and made a profit out of my father's assets
(lands, cranes, bulldozers, excavators, trucks, etc……). In the meantime, his unconscious
jealousy led him to teach me how to use Yaba and crystal meth and I was taught to have
a relationship with whores in Karaoke for 30 days with 30 different girls. I ended up having sex two times.
As I was mistaught by my uncle, I would start socializing with the wrong friends who claimed to represent
NLP -Burmese democrats but turned out to be the other side while studying Business management in Singapore.
We abused K2/ spice (syntactic weed) for a whole year followed by smoking weed and popping Xanax, benzos, and morphine 
from prescriptions or illegals by any means. 

      </p>

       <p>
         At exactly two years I failed and dropped out of that institute, and I remember I suffered intense depression, 
anxiety, and paranoia from excessive drug use. We would abuse drugs; my friend would rap, and I produced music with unhealthy trap cultures.
Moreover, we started the room renting business we would rent the whole flat near our university and lease a room at a slightly higher price. 
I am the one who uses Facebook to find tenants and clean the whole apartment just for having. I would try Airbnb and
every possible social site to get tenants to keep me going I do all the heavy lifting. My
friend ended up suing all the money on drugs and he took advantage of my empathy
and kindness we were all caught up in the financial trap of Singapore for I had started part-time and hustling as my drug problem got severe.
In the end, I ended up giving up the business and my unit life and got back to Burma when I was 22. The worst was during the Singapore time 
I outburst all my suffering from my uncle to my 19-year-old stepsister I ended up molested and sexually assaulted her despite knowing my disability.

      </p>

       <p>
         As a failure and drug addict, I would find every over-the-counter cough syrup
and marijuana (high-quality Thailand imported press, Kush, press, buds as well as local
plants) just to cope and alcohol as well. All I am doing is escaping from my failures. As
As soon as I got back, I was forced to work in Mandalay, and I spotted an unqualified engineer
taking advantage of our noodle business by mishandling the machines, especially motors
(the low-quality material makes the motors break down frequently) as my small aunt is
the one in charge of the factory with any background in machinery. I ended up
criticizing how she operated the business, thus, I was systematically bullied and abused,
and I must apologize to my small aunt and all the factory workers for correctly accusing
them. 

      </p>

       <p>
         As my big aunt secretly believed my ability, I was sent back to Taunggyi to operate
the noodle factory that closed due to my small uncle's mental health and his wife being
pregnant. The machines were filled with iron rust. They group me with experienced
engineers, and I must operate as an engineering manager. I thought he was well experienced
with noodle machines but due to the maintenance problem, one pinion got destroyed.
Upon careful inspection and seeking mentorship from an old-school mechanical
engineer, the machines are not properly lubricated, and the gearbox is not properly filled
with the right kind of lubrication. With the right kind of knowledge, I was able to maintain
the machine properly. I started a relationship with a girl called K who is hot and has toxic
femineity qualities we would enjoy sex a lot, but I struggle with ED due to excessive smoking.

      </p>


     <p>
       I smoke 2 packs a day at that time altogether with weed and all the other drugs including Alcohol. At the same time, 
I started reading 48 Law of Power, Game Theory, The Law of Human Nature, The Art of War, 33 Strategies of War, manipulation, 
dark psychology, atomic habit, psychology of money, the intelligent investor, Mystery, chess opening books, chess puzzles 
and play chess repeatedly by myself I end up beating chess to all surrounding people. After that, I got into a relationship 
with a good girl who suffers from anxiety, she is trying to help me I end up pushing her away and breaking up with her block she 
and I regarded it she is the best I will ever have.

      </p>

       <p>
               After that there was an issue with electricity as electricians tend to overcharge the
price with minimum responsibility, thus, I started learning how to use multimeters from
electric component shop specialist Mr Kyaw. After multiple failed attempts and
component breakdowns, I was able to learn how to detect, inspect, and replace broken
components without any help from electric technicians. I became a repair man,
and account manager and I even read a paper on instant noodles and improved noodle quality.

      </p>


       <p>
                  As the weather in Taunggyi is too cold, thus, sun drying becomes problematic and
the heating room has become a problem to solve, the physics of how drying materials
work is involved. I was able to use my knowledge of physics and mathematics to detect
their theory behind drying materials to provide solutions for heating rooms and better
drying techniques. After that onward I would read the book Manage Factory Play Chess and Covid 
and lock down in 2020. On lockdown playing chess by myself, reading books, music production smoking weed, 
and drinking became usual. I set up my gym including all boxing equipment and weights. 
In 2021 the coup started I was involved in all sorts of protests for democracy.

      </p>

       <p>
                   I was involved in numerous peaceful protests and tear gas was often thrown followed
by shootings with massive crackdowns. I remember that Coca-Cola was the perfect remedy
to wash the eyes burned from tear gas. There was one time my friend sacrificed himself just to be a decoy 
for our protest group to escape. Some of my friends got hunted and murdered. My stepsister was jailed 
for 6 months for being involved in a protest. I was involved heavily with ground reports for peaceful protests 
to provide intelligence on police and soldiers' locations.

      </p>

       <p>
                   I was nearly shot twice for doing that. I got a warning letter for doing so from
the state. The coup itself was devastating as I heard the lawyer friends doing civil disobedience moment 
for, he suffered the consequences of unemployment made him extremely depressed with alcoholism and he died 
in future when I was in my second year in Brunel. I saw my gay friend Sai Thia get sexually abused by the soldiers. 
During that time, I saw a division between my friends who stood for democrats and who were with the states. 
As someone with multiple personality disorder, I found a constant struggle between two friendship groups one with democrats, 
and one with the state. Even though I was with my rich and ADHD friends I was often mislabelled as a traitor for constantly 
collecting the intelligence on inside information on soldiers, police, and general information from them.

      </p>

       <p>
         The police and soldiers would constantly hunt me down as I knew the protest
routing ins and outs as it would be valuable information for them. There are times when
the police would point a gun at us. The crackdown on protests is so severe that I delete
all my political-related posts as I receive new and unfamiliar friend requests mostly from
military and state investigators to social engineering and to ditch out information as VPN
keeps me and people from Burma safe from leaking my current whereabouts. I would make donations
to those who participate in the civil disobedient movement and people's defense forces as well as 
constantly hide from police as well as do my daily job. When I turned 23 my uncle Phillip encouraged me to come and study for the UK and asked me
to eliminate all the evidence for safety it is when I decided to prepare for my IELTS, and I got 7.5 in total score.


      </p>

       <p>
            I would smoke CBD not daily as I need it for my anxiety and general sleep. Other than that, I do not smoke or drink heavily. I drink once in a week. 
         I started going to the University of G for my first year, in which Python coding was a struggle as never in my life I do not learn how to code. Noticeably, 
         I took an online class as well as a coding class from the university itself and I managed to write the entire clothing management system. As the coding skill is transferable,
         I managed to finish my automatic bin opener project at the same time. I got first class as a result despite that Cheatham, Gloucester buses are not timely, 
         so I ended up walking for an hour a day to arrive at the university on time.
      </p>

       <p>
         I was put into a position to buy my tools for my bin projects which are 100-pound worth as the university fails to provide the required materials.
         Also, I was being heavily judged and treated unprofessionally by one specific lab technician, and I felt like being dissipated from the chances that 
         I deserved such internship and job opportunities equally along with my friend Jack Wills. Along with that, my Irish friend Jack who I help in mathematics 
         and engineering design ended up dropping out. He is struggling with part-time for his financial problem with the loan.

      </p>

       <p>
                     I wish I could do more for him I cannot get in contact with him till now. He is like me special trying to do the antique auction to make a profit
         at the same time studying. He is the same age as me. As I am not quite satisfied with the first-year university, I reapply my second visa paid the price, and 
         apply a second year at B university. Before I started my second year, I was learning online courses for my AI and computer networking skills and having a family trip 
         to Thailand. I smoke legalized marijuana and enjoy street foods and exotic fruits along with my big group of siblings and cousins. 
      </p>

       <p>
             My weed intake started only when I started my second year when I started smoking in Thailand. Before that, I never took or smoked any weed or cigarettes in my first year I am clean.
         During the break, I was involved with various political parties, protests, activities, and donations in London for Burma's freedom but I saw young generations of fake democrats 
         who recruit and lead the young generation with Lean and weed cultures who come from a military family and say they are democrats but they lie the takes the advantage of 
         the UK asylum system has to offer. During that time I saw a Burmese PhD student in Brunel who claimed himself is support the democrat while seemed to come from a military background 
         (I am not sure) I was keeping an eye on him and constantly felt unsafe while watching his every move.

      </p>

       <p>
         After that, I started my second year, and I got a B- for an electronic project. 
I solved for the group and one of my group mates got an A+ for copying what I did the same. On top of that,
I took medicine for my fever and wrote my report for my project, and I was left with a B- as well. Despite that, 
I managed to pass with first class for my second year. In the third year, I was heavily involved with AI projects in the summertime, 
and I learned the basic aspects of AI from my prof T and one PhD student who took my algorithms withought appreciation. 


      </p>

       <p>
         As my existing ML and data science skills serve me well, I was able to master 
creating AI algorithms for images and signals. Also, I was able to find the distilled version of chat GPT for general medical questions and answers as according 
to the university it is a PHD level. Even though I hide away my ML skills and stay humble, due to stress I end up criticising the last project in my ML class. 
I saw an eye gazing upon me from the senior class lecture. I saw the eye angry and psychopathic eyes from her. During that, I ended up having an online relationship 
with a Muslim girl and I thought I was normal until I figured I could not love any girl or boy she would constantly ask me to prey a lot, and I felt like I was dealing with Islamic extremist,
she would judge me for not eating what a Muslim would eat especially for eating clam which is normal according to Chinese Muslim standards.

      </p>

       <p>
         She would criticize my moderate drinking behavior. After that, I found L through 
Bingo Live and we started chatting on telegram at first, she acted weird, and she would 
ask me for money through PayPal and electronic money. I Judge her based on my past experiences 
I thought she was a gold digger or some sort I ended up sending her 160 and blocked her for my financial safety. 
The truth is I was wrong as one month later she sent me back 160 exactly through PayPal. 
She needs money to feed her little cousins, and she has been trying to earn by any means just to support
her little brothers. In the end, it turns out it's a fraud or scam as per the Nation Wide bank suggestion.

         A night before an exam I was going out for a pizza on my way back a guy approached
me for the slice saying he was hungry, and he touched my hands I felt the moisture sensation on the touch, and the next day,
I started developing a panic attack in the exam room turn out I was drugged using LSD  without knowing it. 
I was taking an exam and in the middle of it I got a panic attack I went out for fresh air and retook the and I managed to finish it 
I had a hard time sleeping that night of my panic attack, thus, I had to go to Hillington Hospital and wait for 3 hours for a proper drug test 
for my sleeping medicine at A and E. On the second exam day 3 hours before the exam, my panic attack got severe, and I had to rush to the hospital and ask a doctor for medicine take it, and
continue my exam. On the same night, I remember bringing my exam note and memorizing it in the 3-hour waiting time just to get medicine for sleep. On the third day, I managed
to take an exam with no stress as the university arranged a special position for me with no
crowing the same 3 hr wait with a drug test at Hillington Hospital. The fourth day happens similarly.

           After that I got my GP appointment for my prescriptions they prescribe with drugs, as I have a history of massive drug abuse, and my dosage is high and unpredictable.
I ended up calling my weed dealer for a dosage adjustment, I thought they were helping me but they drugged me with Iowska as I could see the leaves mixture along with my prescription drug.
During that moment, my family's fail-safe brainwashing hypnosis kicked in and I was shocked to figure out I was the real Democrat who had been operating in the grey area subconsciously 
so much that they didn’t have any information and I felt like I was brought back to myself I have two personalities one is L extreme feminine and one is Htet who is egotistic with 
Hyper-intelligent and psychopath or dark empathy. When my senses got activated, I remembered I looked at my weed dealer and his friend's eyes and says I am the cat that came here to catch 
a rat like you and you and fear me want the psychopath is it her I am. I am that dark empathy fear me and at the same time I saw the fear of upcoming monsters that they may face. 
The next day I ran out of my meds and asked a doctor she refused to provide me one as I used up all the meds along with misleading little rat friends.

         So, I decided to buy codeine from my dealer again I had one cup and was about to pass out. Suddenly, I remember my father, and, in my mind, I refuse to end up like him,
         I rush to Hillington Hospital tell the truth, and seek help from my family members. When I thought I was safe, they mixed ketamine with food and made me paranoid 
         again by smoking weed and CBD. It is when I discovered back in the day my family member got hospitalized for the same reaction. I deducted they were recreating the same thing 
         and what to frame me as a weed addict. It is when I realize I must go somewhere private for my disability. For my safety, I ended up in TLC private hospital. Through the rehab, I started 
         chatting with Linda again. Even though I have no emotion, the text messages keep me going with her, but I feel sorry for her as I am a psychopath who cannot love or feel any emotions.

      To conclude all my life, I feel like I have been judged abused, and citied. And I believe there are kids like me who suffer the same faith less or worse. 
         No matter what I will be that eye that looks over the children in the meantime I will be that psychopath who punishes legally and lawfully those 
         who don’t even know they are disabled and outbursts to the weak. The fire in me will never end. As long as I exit all the child abuse and sexual harassment, 
         inequality and democracy and freedom will exit and I admit I am the lunatic who wrongfully thinks of it even if it is wrong I rather stay insane to help children, 
         and elders and protect gay rights rather than being sane with a bunch of low IQ monsters who think they can break the laws just because of their disability and smoking little weed 
         and drinking lean.

       <p>
         At the same time as a 19 year old stepsis molester myself I will stay away from children. If there is no justice, I will be the justice I will use any means necessary to protect
         and keep an eye I am that eye I am that light there are L around me as well as low intelligent psychopaths I will enforce more L like me and fight the monsters legally 
         I will be that red hood. Also, even if I am straight, I will protect Gays and all genders that they may label as deep down there is a reason people become it. 
         I will show those fake-ass NLP democrats who come from military backgrounds and live in the UK and enjoy what this country has to offer smoke weed and drink lean do drugs 
         and mislead the younger generation. I will show what real dark empathy looks like to those military psychopaths from Burma who are abusing systems. Justice must be served systematically 
         with the right intent. I will be that cat who catches rats that are polluting the earth. Also, during the rehab, I found one special girl who was being abused by my kind, and 
         I started developing feelings for her and I am shocked to discover the heartless monster can love. I am especially attracted to crazy girls who are ketamine and drug addicts as 
         I used to abuse spice which is the grandpa's version of ketamine and single moms. In the end, I believe the anti-social that society calls us can go out be on light go to the gym, and 
         socialize even though we need prescriptions to function. I am sick and tired of living in my little room I am going to fix myself first be a man up. After that If given a chance,
         I will join Law and order or become a lecturer who teaches kids about the misuse of drugs or helps elders as well as helping kids who are being abused.  I will play the cat and 
         mouse game in the UK. I believe psychopathy is two coins one is dark uncontrolled size, and the other is the controlled version like us. We controlled dark empathies to become 
         brilliant entrepreneurs, real estate agents, Lawyers, policemen, brilliant professors, Doctors, Athletes, Engineers, trash collectors, government staff, and overachievers 
         who contribute good value to society.
