      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        On 26 May 1995, as soon as I turn one my parent got divorced in Taunggyi which is
the mountain area. (I remember the whole mountain turn pink in winter from cherry trees)
when I was exactly 3-year-old I saw a superman movie and jump from the stair I thought
I was going to fly but instead I was hospitalized with broken elbow and been exposed with
sedatives at early age. My brain chemical had been changed, and it make me disability
with weak short-term memory. My real birthday was 26 September 1995. My family legally
change it into 26 May 1995 so that I can get to kinder garden despite my undeveloped
brain had been pushed by their greets of wanting not to care take me.
        When I was 4, I was sent to the BEHS4 in Taunggyi and got sent to kinder garden
for special kids or disable kids with ADHD and we don’t know we have ADHD. Along with
that I was sexually abused by the house mate every night as she would call me to play just
to have sex with me. My male part is barely able to stiff, and I was sexually abused and
assaulted and expose the toxic femineity at early age. Not only that my uncle would
squeeze my nipples often just to abuse me sexually altogether with my bipolar grandpa
and my middle aunt. My middle aunt would molest me touch my ass and male body parts.
Not only that, but I also have a habit of vomiting when I started crying. Just to
discipline me my bipolar middle aunt would force me to eat what I vomited, and it work
nicely.
        All my life I don’t have play time for socializing time as all my childhood is filled
with tuitions such as Grammer class, math class, Chinese language, pre-school training
classes and I don’t have any holiday as all my free times are filled with various classes.
On top of that my aunt would ask me to study religious from Muslim priests. Most of the
priests 80% of them like to spread hatred through tales and lies. Some actively recruiting
to be volunteer terrorists. They usually operate in Rohingya area, and the truth is the
Rohingya are not as clear as there are real terrorists hiding among them in the Yakine area
and Mother Su was not wrong to bring them down.
        Along with that work hard culture is deep rooted in family as I was forced to work
in early age. As being a dare devil and trouble kids, playing with friends create minor
problems as to avoid those, I was forced to play alone at home with various toys. I would
tear down toys to appreciate the circuit architecture and use Motors form toys just to
make a boat with junks I found in my house. Not only that I was a kid that occasional drift
with bicycles by slamming rear brakes. I used to have lots of pets including dogs and cats,
but I cannot care them much as I was constantly occupied with my studies, and they end
up dying in accidents. After those accidents I plan not to have any pets again and learn to
love form distance.
        I would build a well from stones and left over concretes. I would play with light
bulbs and AC sockets one time I remember I got electric shock from doing such. I
remember my grandpa would buy me a fish form market and teach me how to breed them
and sell them. Also, I would play around with iron power powder and magnet. Also, I
remember playing with magnet attach the rope in middle just to use it as compass as the
magnet usually stick to north and south side. I would wrap the wire as coils and push
magnet in and out and see the light bulb blink. Sometimes I would play checker by myself.
I develop reading sherlock homes, 5 habit of highly eUective people, body languages and
other books at an early age.
        When I turn 9, I started chewing tobacco and Bettles along with my classmates
just for an escape. I was involved in smoking (especially in the school bathroom) it is not
permitted. At the same time, I was a bully, and I would bully all my classmates especially
who is perverted (deep down I hate the idea of toxic masculinity form my grandpa and a
sense to protect the femineity and gay friends). I send love letters and valentines gifts to
girls which end up in trash cans all the time. At the same time, I started visiting my mom
restart in the market frequently without all my family member form father size aware of it.
At early 12 I started smoking from my grandpa left over cigarettes and after that I
start sealing my grandpa 555 cigarettes and it was the best cigarette of my life. My
grandpa is harsh, and he hate the idea of wasting food that I was forced to eat the food
that I drop on the ground just to teach me a lesson.
        I would buy a pack of ciggie after my high school and hide and smoke it as my
caretaker or aunt is too busy for taking care of family business and other disabled in my
family. Along with that nightly drinking after tuition become habitual as the personal
driver would buy a beer for me after ever night along with occasional alcohol at local bar.
At late 13 I was sent to special school, and it was the best productive year of my life as
the hypnotherapist Dr Aung is the one in charge. Rumours were spared about him as Dr
Aung is not his real name and his family got divorces at the early age as me. At the same
time my obsession with death note started and I would watch death note repeatedly. At
the same time, I started reading mathematics related books. Spookley, he would call my
other friends or roommates just to sleep with him and it was terrible. On top of that
occasion fight with bullies happen frequently among peers.
          Who know he would use spooky hypnosis on me and my friends. As I report to my
family, and they move me to the other institute. At the same time, I have a frequent dream
from my aunt especially big aunt and the middle aunt having sex with me in my dreams it
happens daily. Also, the hypnotherapist would frequently assign or tasks that is relatively
diUicult to solve I believe I am the one who can answer the question in most of the time.
There is a spoon on the water question he asks why the water did not drop if u keep
dripping on the spoon I try to give him an answer, but he reject it every time he come up
with better solution to beat me down. I believe I said it was gravity, and he denies it is a
right answer but manage to prove me wrong in his way. The same time I would constantly
watch death note repeatedly and I see myself as L in that death note character and I hate
Killer who cause nothing but chaos and egoistic and think himself delusional with his ego
not a real intelligent. I feel like my brain is being experimented and studied by him taken
advantage of my disability in spite of the full money or fees he requested.
        After that I end up moving to another institute. When the A’s student got an A form
following the teacher’s techniques, I was being punish for using other methods as I
always finds two three methods just to solve a single mathematics problem but got
rejected. When they ask me write English essay, I would write it in my own understanding
with my own sentences and got punished for just not to memorize and write what the
teacher as me to memorize essays. At the same time my friend would tease me for having
man boobs and squeeze my nipples for his sexual pleasure needs. At 14 when I was in
high school, I started using opioid with my friend James as he would scrap his brother left
over raw opioid and bring them to high schools that is the best high, I got as me would
body weakens, and I remember I saw leaves dropping slowly form trees.
        After high school at 15 I was sent to engineer school in Yangon as the school itself
is relatively new and unprofessional, I end up moving and studying both foundation in
Electrical and electronic engineering for six months follow by six-month Business
management foundation degree in Chindwin college Mandalay. In my college days I
would drink all the time, and I become alcoholic and got addicted to it. Also, I remember
days I would wake up with shaking hands rush to nearby bar take a shot just to stabilize
as the social drinking culture in college is everywhere. At the same time, I started a
distance relationship with my first ex she ends up leaving me for another man and
tell me I was not enough.
        Along with that I was involve with the car gang call GFD-ground force drifters and I
drive Nissan fair lady FZ33 along with Honda CBR 250 and CB 650R bicycles. I would do
dangerous stunts, drift car do burn out donuts, traUic race, drag race, involve in group
fights and smoke the mixture of weed and opioids. Along with that jumping rope and
boxing has become my daily activity. 
        On top of that I learn how to drive Cranes and heavy-duty Trucks. I was enjoying
my life until when I was 19, my grandma passed away. Three months after that, for
mysterious reason, my father got hit in his head as his main business was doing
construction business with the authorities in building new city call Nay Pyi taw, Chinese
gas pipeline construction for natural gas supply and copper mining in red copper
mountain area. I suspect he is unlawfully punished by authorities for knowing too much
about shady Chinese business and at that time the Burmese government own unpaid
depts from him.
        For that consequence, he suffers brain damage from blood cloth. I was devastated
and as my dad was being an addict who take Yaba for work and sleep with raw opioid as
most government authorities and its associates fellow business man would do, his
addiction problem got along with brain damage got worst I remember the time I have to
search the supply in Nay Pyi Taw and personally arrange the transport Yaba (the green one
is special) as well as asking opioid from friends in GFD from him. I remember the days he
would drive to the police authority house and buy opioid and Yaba form Police.
        Along with that, the Rohingya and Muslim massacre happen I remember the 969
Buddhist extremist(brainwash and spoiled with Yaba and other drugs) would come to
near my home as I live near mosque as I am being a Chinese Muslim and I was shaking
and holding a kitchen knife just for protection I try to ask help form police and they
pretend like nothing happen although the extremists come to destroy mosque and nearby
buildings. At the same time, we send my father a private rehab centre. He is clean and
we are planning to treat his blood cloth problem in the brain he started using Yaba and
opioid again. Due to excessive use, wrong dosage adjustment and his lung problem from
using Yaba, he got overdosed and had to be hospitalized and he passed away when I was
19. My family cannot do any lawsuit or case as my father death is tied with Burmese
government authorises.
          Due to safety my family plan to send me to study business management in
Singapore. Before that I was left with my uncle in Nay Pyi Taw just to turn my father left
over assets, but he takes advantage of that and make a profit out of my father assets
(lands, cranes, bulldozers, excavators, trucks, etc……). In the meantime, his unconscious
jealousy led him to teach me how to use Yaba, crystal meth and I was taught to have
relationship with whores in Karaoke for 30 days with 30 diUerent girls. I end up having sex
two times I admit, and it is a degusting. After that I studied in SIM (Singapore Institute of
Management) as being mistaught by uncle, I would start socializing with wrong friends
who claim to represent NLP -Burmese democrat but turn out to be the other size.
We abuse K2/ spice for a whole year with follow by smoking weed and popping
Xanax, benzos and morphine from prescriptions or unprescriptions by any means. At
exactly two years I fail and dropout form that institute and I remember I suUer intense
depression, anxiety and paranoia from excessive drug use. We would abuse drugs; my
friend would rap, and I produce music with unhealthy trap cultures.
          Moreover, we started the room renting business we would rent the whole flat near
our university and lease a room with slightly higher price. I am the one who use Facebook
to find tenientes and clean the whole apartment just for having. I would try air bnb and
every possible social site to get tenientes to keep me going I dop all the heavy lifting. My
friend he ends up suing all the money on drugs and himself take advantage of my empathy
and kindness we all caught up in financial trap of Singapore for that I must start part time
and hustling as my drugs problem got severe. In the end I end up giving up the business
my unit life and got back to Burma when I was 22. The worst is during those Singapore
time I outburst all my suUering from my uncle to my stepsister I end up molested and
sexually assaulted from her with ought knowing my disability.
      As being a failure and drug addict, I would find every over-the-counter cough syrup
and marijuana (high quality Thailand imported press, Kush, press, buds as well as local
plants) just to cope and alcohol as well. All I am doing is escaping from my failures. As
soon as I got back, I was forced to work in Mandalay, and I spot an unqualify engineer
taking advantage of our noodle business by mis handling the machines especially motors
(the low-quality material makes the motors break down frequently) as my small aunt is
the one in charge of the factory with ought any background on machineries. I end up
criticize how she operates the business, thus, I was systematically bullied and abused,
and I must apologize my small aunt and all the factory worker for being correctly accusing
them. At the same time,
            As my big aunt secretly believe my ability, I was sent back to Taunggyi to operate
the noodle factory that close due to my small uncle mental health and his wife is
pregnant. The machines were filled with iron rusts. They group me with experience
engineer, and I must operate as engineering manager. I thought he is well experienced
with noodle machines but due to maintained problem one pinion got destroy.
Upon careful inspection and seeking mentorship from old school mechanical
engineer, the machines are not properly lubricated, and the gear box is not properly filled
with right kind of lubrication. With the right king of knowledge, I was able to maintain
machine properly. I started relationship with a girl call Kay Kay who is hot and have toxic
femineity quality we would enjoy sex a lot, but I struggle with ED due to excessive smoking
I smoke 2 pack a day at that time altogether with weed and all the other drugs including
alcohol.
            At the same time I started reading 48 law of power, game theory, law of human
nature, the art of war, 33 strategy of war, manipulation, dark psychology, atomic habit,
psychology of money, the intelligent investor, Mystery, chess opening books, chess
puzzles and play chess over and over again by myself I end up beating chess to all
surrounding peoples. After that I got into relationship with a good girl who is suffer anxiety,
she is trying to help me I end up pushing her away and break up with her block her and I
regarded it she is the best I will ever have.
          After that there is an issue with electricity as electrician tend to overcharge the
price with minimum responsibility, thus, I started learning how to use mustimeters from
electric component shop specialist Mr Kyaw. After multiple fail attempts and
components break down, I was able to learn how to detect, inspect and replace broken
components with ought any help from electric technicians. I become repair man,
account manager and I even read a paper on instant noodles and improve noodle quality.
          As the weather in Taunggyi is too cold, thus, sun drying become problematic and
the heating room has become a problem to solve it, the physics of how drying materials
work is involved. I was able to use my knowledge on physics and mathematics to detect
their theory behind drying materials to provide solutions for heating room and better
drying techniques. After that onward I would read book manage factory play chess and
covid and lock down become in 2020. On lockdown play chess by self, read books, music
production smoke weed, and drink become a usual. I set up my personal gym including
all boxing equipment and weights. In 2021 the coup started I was involved in all sorts of
protest for democracy.
          I was involved in numerous peaceful protests and tear gas was often thrown follow
by shootings with massive crack down. I remember the coca cola was the perfect remedy
to wash the eyes burn from tear gas. There is one time my friend sacriscify himself just to
be decoy for our protest group to escape. Some of my friends got hunted and murdered.
My stepsister we jailed for 6 months for involve in protest. I was involved heavily with
ground report for peaceful protests to provide intelligence on police and soldiers
location.
          I was nearly shot twice for doing that. I got a warning letters from doing so from
the state. The coup itself is devastating as I heard the lawyer friends doing civil disobey
moment for that he suUers consequences the unemployment makes him extremely
depressed with alcoholism and he die in future when I was in my second year in Brunel. I
saw my gay friend Sai Thia got sexually abused by the soldiers.
During those time I saw a division between my friends who stand for democrats
and who is with states. As being a two-face person, I found a constant struggle between
two friendship group one democrats, and one is with state. Even though I was with my
rich and ADHD friends I often mislabelled as traitors for constantly collecting the
intelligence on inside information on soldiers, police and general information from them.
            The police and soldiers would constantly hunt me down as I know the protest
routing ins and outs as it would be valuable information for them. There are times when
the police would point a gun at us. The crack down on protests is so severe that I delete
all my political related posts as I receive a new and unfamiliar friend requests mostly form
military and state investigators to social engineering and to ditch out information as VPN
keep me and people from Burma safe from leaking my current whereabouts.
I would do donations to those who participate in civil disobedient movement and
people defence forces as well as constantly hiding from police as well as doing my daily
job. When I turn 23 my uncle Phillip encourage me to come and study for UK and ask me
to eliminate all the evidence for the safety it is when I decided to prepare for my IELTS,
and I got 7.5 in total score.
        I would smoke CBD not daily as I need it for my anxiety and general sleep. Other than that,
I do not smoke nor drink heavily. I drink once in a week. I started going to university of Gloucester 
for my first year, which python coding is a struggle as neve been in my life I never code does not learn 
how to code. Noticeably, I took an online class as well as coding class from university itself and
I was managed to write the entire clothing management system. As the coding skill is
transferable, I was managed to finish my automatic bin opener project at the same time.
I got first class as a result despite that Cheatham, Gloucester buses are not timely, so I
end up walking for an hour a day to arrive university timely.
          I was put into a position to buy my own tools for my bin projects which is 100-
pound worth as the university fail to provide requires materials. Also, I was being heavily
judged and treated unprofessionally from one specific lab technician, and I feel like being
dissipated from the chances that I deserve such as internship and job opportunity equally
along with my friend Jack Wills. Along with that, my friend Jack will who I help in
mathematics and engineering design end up dropping out. He is struggling with part time
for his financial problem with the loan.
            I wish I can do more for him I cannot get contact with him till now. He is like me
special trying to do the antique auction to make profit at the same time studying. He is
same age as me. As I am not quite satisfied with the first-year university, I reapply my
second visa paid the double price and apply second year at Brunel university. Before I
start my second year, I was learning online courses for my ai and computer networking
skills and having a family trip to Thailand. I smoke legalized marijuana and enjoying street
foods and exotic fruits with along with my big group of siblings and cousins. 
        My weed intake started only when I started second year when I started smoking in Thailand.
Prior to that I never takes or smoke any weed nor cigarettes in my first year I am clean.
During the break, I was involve with various political parties, protests, activities
and donations in London for Burma freedom but I saw young generations or fake
democrats who recruit and lead the young generation with Lean and weed cultures who
come from military family and calming they are democrats but they lie the takes the
advantage of the UK asylum system has to oUer. During those time I saw one Burmese
PHD student in Brunel who claim himself is supporting the democrat while who seem to
came from military background I was keeping an eye on him and constantly feel unsafe
from him while keep watching him every moves.
        After that I started my second year, and I got B- for an electronic project that 
I solve for group and one of my group mates got and A+ for copying what I did the same. On top
of that I took medicine from my fever and write my report for my project, and I was left
with B- as well. Despite that I manage to pass with first class for my second year. In the
third year I was heavily involved with AI projects in my summertime, and I learn basics
aspects of AI from my prof T's and one PHD student who took my algorithms with
unproper appreciation from him. 
          As my existing ML and data science skills serve me well, I was able to master in
creating AI algorithms for images and signal. Also, I was able to fine tune distil version of
chat GPT for general medical question and answer as according to university it is a PHD
level. Even though I hide away my ML skills stay humble, due to stress I end up critizing
last project on my ML class. I saw an eye gazing upon me from the senior class lecture.
        I saw the eye an angry and psychopathic eyes from her. During that I end up having an 
online relationship with one Muslim girl and I thought I was normal until I figure I cannot 
love any girl or boys and she would constantly ask me to prey a lot and I feel like I am dealing 
with Islamic extremist she would judge me for not eating what a Muslim would eat especially 
for eating clam which is normal according to Chinese Muslim standard.
        She would criticize on my moderate drinking behaviour. After that I found L through 
bingo live and we started chatting on telegram and at first, she acts wired and she would 
ask me for money through pay pal and electronic money. I Judge her based on my past experiences 
I thought she was gold digger or some sort I end up sending her 160 and block her for my financial safety. 
The truth is I was wrong as one month later she sends me back 160 exactly through pay pal. 
She need money to feed her little cousins and she been trying to earn by any mean just to support
her little brothers.
          A night before an exam I was going out for a pizza on my way back a guy approach
me for the slice saying he is hungry and he touch my hands I feel the moisture sensation
on the touch and the next day I start developing a panic attack in exam room turn out I
was drugged using LSD or Ketamine or some sort with ought knowing it. I was taking an
exam and in the middle of it I got panic attack I go out for fresh air and retake an exam and
I was manage to finish it I have hard time sleeping that night with my panic attack, thus, I
have to go to Hillington hospital wait for 3 hours with proper drug test for my sleeping
medicine at A and E. On the second exam day 3 hour before the exam, my panic attack
got severed and I must rush to hospital and ask a doctor for a medicine take it and
continue my exam. In the same night I remember bringing my exam note and memorize it
in the 3-hr waiting time just to get a medicine for sleep. On the third day I was managed
to take an exam with no stress as the university arrange special position for me with no
crowing the same 3 hr wait with drug test at Hillington hospital happen. The fourth day
happen similarly. 
        After that I got my GP appointment for my prescriptions they prescribe
with drugs as I have the history of massive drug abuse, my dosage is high and
unpredictable I end up calling my weed dealer for a dosage adjustment, I thought they
are helping me but they drugged me with iowska as I can see the leaves mixtures along
with my prescriptions drug. During those moment, my family fail safe brainwashing
hypnosis kick in and I was shock to figure out I am the real democrat who had been
operating in the grey area subconsciously so much that they don’t got any information
and I feel like I was bring back to my self which I have two personality one is L extreme
feminine and one is Htet who is the egotistic with Hyper intelligent and psychopath or
dark empathy. When my sense got activated, I remember I look at my weed dealer and
his friend eyes and say I am the cat that come here to catch a rat like u and fear me u want
psychopath is it her I am. I am that dark empathy fear me and at the same time I saw the
fear of upcoming monster that they may face. The next day I run out of my meds and ask
a doctor she refuse to provide me one as I used up all the meds along with misleading
little rat friends. 
        So, I decided to buy a codeine form my dealer again I have one cups and
about to passed out. Suddenly, I remember my father, and, in my mind, I refuse to be end
up like him, and I rush to Hillington hospital tell the truth and seek help form my family
member. When I thought I was safe, they mix ketamine with food and make paranoid
again by smoking weed and CBD. It is when I discover back in the day my family member
got hospitalized for the same reaction. I deducted they are recreating the same thing and
what to frame me as weed addict. It is when I realize I must go somewhere private for my
disability. For my safety I ended up in TLC rehab. Thought the rehab I started chatting with
Linda again. Even though I have no emotion, the text messages keep me going with her,
but I feel sorry for her as I am being a psychopath who cannot love or feel any emotions.
To conclude all my life, I feel like I been judged abused and citied. And I believe
there are kids like me who suUer the same faith less or worst. No matter what I will be that
eye that look over the children in the meantime I will be that psychopath who punish
legally and lawfully to those who don’t even know they are disable and outburst to the
weak. The fire in me will never end as. Long as I exit all the child abuse sexual harassment,
inequality and democracy and freedom will exit and I admit I am the lunatic who
wrongfully think of it even if it is wrong I rather stay insane to help children, elders and gay
right than being sane with a bunch of low IQ monsters who think they can break the laws
just because of their disability. 
        At the same time as a child molester myself I will stay from children. 
If there is no justice, I will be the justice I will use any mean necessary to protect
and keep an eye I am that eye I am that light there are L around me as well as low
intelligent psychopaths I will enforce more L like me and fight the monsters legally I will
be that red hood. Also, even if I am straight, I will protect Gay and all genders that they
may label as deep down there is a reason people become it. I will show those fake ass
NLP democrats who come from military background and living in the UK and enjoying
what this country has to oUer smoke weed and drink lean do drugs and misleading the
younger generation. I will show what the real dark empathy looks like to those military
psychopaths from Burma who is abusing systems. Justice must be served systematically
with the right intent. I will be that cat who catch rats that is polluting the earth.
Also during the rehab I found one special gril who is being abused by my kind and I started 
developing feeling form her and I am shocked to discover the heartless monster can love.
I am especially attracted to crazy girls, womens ans single moms. In the end I believe the 
anti social that the society call us can go out can be on light can go to gym asn socialize
even though we need pescriptions to function. I ams sick and tired of living in my little room
I am gonna fix myself first. After that If given a chance I will join law and order or become lecture 
who teach kids about misue of drugs or help elders as well as helping kids who are being abused. 
I will play the cat and mouse game in UK. I believe psycopathy is two coin one is dark uncontrolled 
size and the other is the controlled version. We controlled psycopaths become brilliant entrepernurs, 
Lawyers, Policemans, Brilliant professors, Athletes, Engineers and over achievers that contribute good 
value to the society.
